Instructions for installing SNooPy can be found at the following website:

Mostly, this has to do with satisfying depencencies. So the short version is
to install the following:

 - Numpy/Scipy
 - Matplotlib
 - ipython
 - pyfits
 - pymc (optional for GP fitting)

Once you've got that installed, simply run the usual:

python setup.py install
