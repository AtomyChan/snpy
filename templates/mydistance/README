This is a small module that contains an anisotropic euclidean distance
function that can be used with pymc's GP package. In this case, given
two N-vecctors positions x[i,k] and y[i,k], with k being the dimension
index:

D[i] = sum((x - y)*scale, axis=1)

where scale[0] == 1 and the rest of the N-1 dimensions can have 
arbitrary positive scales.

You can update the covariance functions to use this metric as in the following:

from pymc.gp.cov_funs import matern
from mydistances import aniso_euclidean_s
matern.add_distance_metric('aniso_euclidean_s', 'mydistances',
                            with_x=False)
