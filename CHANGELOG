20Nov2007: -  Keep a CHANGELOG  ;-)
           -  Keep track of version numbers.  We're now at 0.2

26Nov2007: -  Made some fixes with Mark's help.
	   -  Incorporated Krisciunas' JHK polynomial templates to both
	      dm15temp and dm15temp2 generators.
	   -  sn.plot()  now blanks out bad polynomials

03Dec2007: - Needed to change the 'super' class to 'sn'.  'super' is a
             reserved function in python to obtain a class' super-class,
             which is super-handy.
           - Updated the load() function to test if the saved file is
	     using 'super' and upgrade if needed.
	   - Added the fit_colors functionality to fit() (see docs).
	   - Fixed how get_restbands works (normalization was bad)
	   - set_generator() now automatically calls get_restbands
	   - Major overhaul of mangle_kcorr().  It now recognizes the bad
	     data masks and uses it when computing colors:  the JHK data
	     should now be mangle-able.
	   - Set Hsiao's opt+NIR uberspectrum (H3) as the default for
	     k-corrections.
	   - Updaded default behaviour of fit():  s=1 is now default, set it
	     to None to make it vary.
           - Fixed lc.plot()  to properly show residuals from template fits.

20Jan2008:  pylc is now versioned using SVN
06Jan2009:  pylc is now SNpy (affectionately SNOOPY).
01Feb2009:  Begin the arduouis task of converting over to Numpy, the new
            Scipy, and, heh what the heck, python 2.5.
05Oct2011:  Incorporated the new light-curve templates based on the data 
            released in Stritzinger et al. (2011).  Also, try to remove
            a number of dependencies that are causing problems when porting
            to new architectures.  Sorry, PGPLOT, but you're just too 
            hard to maintain.
